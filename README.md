# 📖 About the Project <a name="about-project"></a>

Welcome to the **Ruby TDD Project**! This project is designed to help you learn and practice Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Ruby. You will create a class called `Solver` and implement various methods while following the TDD approach.

### Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>

- Implement a class called `Solver`.
- Create a `factorial` method that calculates the factorial of a given integer `N`, handling edge cases and raising exceptions for negative integers.
- Implement a `reverse` method that reverses a given string.
- Create a `fizzbuzz` method that follows specific rules for returning strings based on divisibility by 3 and 5.
- Emphasize the TDD approach by writing tests first for all methods.

# 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

To get started with the Ruby TDD Project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>

## 🔭 Future Features <a name="future-features"></a>

1. **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**: Extend TDD to include BDD principles, using tools like Cucumber or RSpec with feature tests and scenarios written in plain language.
2. **Test Data Management**: Implement strategies for managing test data effectively, including fixtures, factories, or database snapshots, to ensure consistent and repeatable tests.
